# hello-world
This is the first repository of mine to practice
So this one here is the first "commit massage" I wrote. 
Apparently and I quote here "On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why."
